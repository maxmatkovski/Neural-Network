## Basic Steps of Neural Network:
### 1. Basic Structure
- Input Layer: Receives input data.
- Hidden Layers: Multiple layers that process the input through weighted connections.
- Output Layer: Produces the final prediction or classification.

- called neural network because it looks like a network 
- data starts at input layer
- input --> hidden layer 1 --> hidden layer 2 --> output layer

- if we're classifying cat or dog, we will have two output neurons
- tuning the "weights and biases" is the process of training the neural network

- each connection == weight
- each neuron == bias

- as we can see the amount of parameters can grow to huge amounts
